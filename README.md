# Password Generator Project

This simple password generator project is built with React and Tailwind CSS. It serves as a practical exercise for utilizing React hooks, including `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useRef`.

## Features

1. **Password Length Selection:**

    - Users can choose the desired length of the generated password.

2. **Include/Exclude Numbers:**

    - Option to include or exclude numbers in the generated password.

3. **Include/Exclude Special Characters:**
    - Users can choose to include or exclude special characters in the generated password.

## React Hooks Used

-   `useEffect`: Manages side effects, such as updating the password based on user input.

-   `useCallback`: Ensures that functions are memoized and don't get recreated unnecessarily.

-   `useRef`: Facilitates interaction with the DOM, enhancing the user experience.
